  // REAL 2026/27 events: parsed from "The City School Events 26" sheet per issue 0018,
  // filter rule applied (staff-only dropped; two no-school staff days rescued per Trevor
  // 2026-07-09; Dec 5 Saturday performance confirmed). Review trail:
  // docs/sources/events-review-2026-27.md. Future live feed (0004) swaps in behind this.
  // type:'gold' MEANS key date / milestone (drives the key-dates .ics feed); 'purple' = everything else.
  // REQUIRED aud (P4 pass A, 2026-07-19): audience taxonomy driving dot colour on the
  // calendar grid + agenda: 'parent' (involves parents: coffee mornings, H&W, info
  // evenings, workshops, PTCs, performances), 'child' (children-only school days: first/
  // last day, athletics/field day, cultural celebrations), 'holiday' (no school / closed).
  // "Registration/booking opens" folds into 'parent'. Presentation metadata, retune freely.
  // Optional until:'YYYY-MM-DD' (inclusive last day) on multi-day rows: drives ICS DTEND
  // (exclusive until+1) in render.js AND build-api's feed; visual surfaces stay start-anchored.
  // Optional nopage:true = deliberately page-less (a portal page is never owed): exempts the
  // row from the Coming-up "coming soon" pill AND the check-coming-up coverage gate. Set on
  // children-only school days and programme rows (summer festivals). aud:'holiday' is exempt
  // without nopage. The gate alerts on any pageless, non-holiday, non-nopage row inside its
  // window: that alert means "build this page or flag it nopage" (deliberate, per plan §9).
  // Optional href (plan 2026-07-16 item 1.1): SITE-ROOT-relative page path
  // ('hopes-and-wishes/') renders the title as a link wherever the event appears
  // and becomes the share target. CLICK-ONLY: href never promotes an event visually
  // (D2); homepage prominence stays editorial (featuredEvents/bookingWindows/notes).
  // Rows sharing one href are one event (the slice-2 grouping key: a featuredEvents
  // card folds every row with its href). NOTE: docs[] hrefs further down use the
  // OTHER convention (page-relative from policies/), do not mix.
  // build-api.mjs strips href from the public calendar JSON.
  // The two Hopes and Wishes rows below carry href: 'hopes-and-wishes/' (plan §2c);
  // build-api.mjs asserts every ptc date has a matching calendar row (one-directional).
  // community flag retired 2026-08-06 (0102): comunita alone decides what lives on community/.
  // Coffee-morning rows additionally carry: cohort (K1|K2|Y1|Y2|'Y3 to Y6'|Dove) ·
  // time/venue (null = "To be confirmed") · slides (null until the deck lands, then
  // { href:'https://…', tag:'PDF' }; HTTPS only or the build gate rejects).
